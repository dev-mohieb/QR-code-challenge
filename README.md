## Overview
  This is my solution to the QR code card challenge. I used variables for the colors, and pixels for the card's dimensions, and percents/rems for the other stuff.

  I thought this was an easy challenge, but it took me about 20 minutes to finish it. I didn't expect it'll take me this long.

## My process
  I built the HTML out of three sections; a 'div.card', 'div.image', and a 'div.info'. 
  
  I put the image in 'div.image' and the text in 'div.info' and I aligned everything using flexbox.

### Built with
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox

### What I learned
  I learned that I needed more experience creating things from scratch, because this challenge seemed easy, but it was a little tricky to get done, not because of lack of knowledge, but because it's my first challenge and I had to rely fully on myself to recreate it. 

### Continued development
  I wanna continue learning about flexbox and layout-ing.
